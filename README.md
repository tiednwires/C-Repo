1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The purpose of the project was to create software that reads in a text file of grocery items, and to then use functions to count how many times that item appeared and store the item with its frequency for displaying back to the user. 

2) What did you do particularly well?

I think the best thing I did was to research what type of data structure would best suit this project instead of just using the last one we learned. I think that using a linked list would have resulted in a ton of extra code compared 
to using the vector of pairs that I chose. The vector of pairs was an ideal data structure for storing a string and its frequency. 

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could have included better error explainations. Instead of just stating that the file failed to open, I could have explained what went wrong and how to fix it. 

4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Nothing was too difficult. If I had to say one thing, it would be learning the vector of pairs and using it. I Googled and watched YouTube for information on using it. 

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Again, the vector of pairs along with range based loops. I can see this exact program being useful in ways beyond tracking groceries. I think it's a good recipe, if you will, to have stored for later use. 

6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

By adhering to the pillars of OOP. Encapsulating and using polymorphism makes the code easy to maintain and re-use in future projects. I could simply re-name things and re-purpose the entire program.
